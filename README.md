Sven (Smart vending machine)

I upgraded Sven so that in Customer Mode when a choice is selected out of the two items that are for sale on Thursday May 30th the item will be correctly removed from the list, as it caused an error before I completed this.
I did this on lines 141-148 using an if else statement that removes the item that is selected by the coustomer.
